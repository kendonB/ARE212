*Empirical example: returns to education* \hfill
*ARE212*: Section 05 \\ \hline \bigskip

We'll start section with a review of some of the common issues on the problem set. Then, we'll use an empirical example to try out categorical dummies, exporting to \latex, and the advanced graphical package =ggplot2=.

* Problem set retrospective

TBD

* Returns to education example

The purpose of this section is to estimate the returns to education using =R=.  There is nothing valid about the results found in this section; but the empirical application gives us a chance to explore categorical dummies and the =ggplot2= package.  First, as always, we load the required libraries.

#+begin_src R :results output graphics :exports both :tangle yes :session
library(foreign)
library(ggplot2)
library(xtable)
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:

We can then read the wage data directly from the online repository for the supplementary data sets for the Wooldridge (2002) text.  You will need an internet connection. We only need the =wage=, =educ=, and =age= variables, and we omit all observations with missing observations using =na.omit()=.

#+begin_src R :results output graphics :exports both :tangle yes :session
f <- "http://fmwww.bc.edu/ec-p/data/wooldridge/wage2.dta"
data <- read.dta(f)
data <- data[ , c("wage", "educ", "age")]
data <- na.omit(data)
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:

A quick visualization reveals the distribution of wages in the data set:

Before we continue, I'll introduce the =%in%= operator, since we'll be using it shortly. The =%in%= operator generates a boolean vector[fn:: A boolean vector is a vector composed entirely of =TRUE=s and =FALSE=s.], depending on whether or not the element in the variable that preceeds is contained within the variable that follows it. That's a confusing explanation. To make this more clear, here's an example:

#+begin_src R :results output graphics :exports both :tangle yes :session
4:12 %in% 1:30
c(5:7) %in% c(1,1,2,3,5,8,13)
c("green","blue","red") %in% c("blue","green")
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: [1] TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE
: [1]  TRUE FALSE FALSE
: [1]  TRUE  TRUE FALSE

We can use =%in%= along with the =ifelse()= command to easily create dummy variables from variables that take on more than two values, like =educ=. Roughly following page 38 of the lecture notes, we create a rough measure of educational attainment from the =educ= variable.

#+begin_src R :results output graphics :exports both :tangle yes :session
e1 <- ifelse(data$educ %in% 1:12, 1, 0)
e2 <- ifelse(data$educ %in% 13:14, 1, 0)
e3 <- ifelse(data$educ %in% 15:16, 1, 0)
e4 <- ifelse(data$educ %in% 17:18, 1, 0)
#+end_src

#+results:

The categorical education variables sum to one, and the =lm()= function will force-drop one of the variables.  Note that the intercept in this regression reflects the mean wage of the =e4= class. The other coefficients reflect the relative wages of the other three classes.

#+begin_src R :results output :exports both :tangle yes :session
lm(wage ~ 1 + e1 + e2 + e3 + e4, data = data)
coef(summary(m1 <- lm(wage ~ 1 + e1 + e2 + e3 + e4, data = data)))

#+end_example

Interpretation is a common challenge in dummy variables, particularly when we start including more complicated dummies or interaction terms. It's a good idea to think hard about what the coefficients from a regression represent. To sharpen your intuition in this regard, we'll use our own =OLS()= function to return the coefficients from a regression of wage on the dummy variables.

#+begin_src R :results output :exports both :tangle yes :session
OLS <- function(y,X) {
  return(solve(t(X) %*% X) %*% t(X) %*% y)
}
X <- cbind(1,e1,e2,e3,e4)
y <- data$wage
b <- OLS(y,X)
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: Error in solve.default(t(X) %*% X) (from #2) : 
:   system is computationally singular: reciprocal condition number = 3.03976e-18

Uh oh! What happened? =OLS()= is not as smart as =lm()=, so it didn't automatically drop any of our dummy variables. Since the dummies sum to a column vector of ones, we violated A2: =X= does not have full column rank. We have a couple of options here: first, we can try dropping the intercept.

#+begin_src R :results output :exports both :tangle yes :session
(b_dropint <- OLS(y,X[ , 2:5]))
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
:         [,1]
: e1  846.4948
: e2  966.9877
: e3 1106.4513
: e4 1196.9588

We can show (but won't) that the coefficients are just the average wage amongst each dummy group. Think of each dummy here as forming its own intercept. Since there are no other covariates, each captures the average wage for all of the observations in that group. We can also see that $b_4$ corresponds to the intercept from the =lm()= output, which is as we expect. It's also simple arithmatic to see that $b_1$, $b_2$, and $b_3$ in the =lm()= results correspond to the difference in the average wage between dummy group 4 and dummy groups 1, 2, and 3 respectively. \\

We can also choose to a different group than group 4. Here, we can choose to drop dummy group 3 and to keep the intercept. What do the intercept and coefficients represent now?

#+begin_src R :results output :exports both :tangle yes :session
(b_drop3 <- OLS(y,X[ , c(1,2,3,5)]))
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:

:    1106.45128
: e1 -259.95648
: e2 -139.46363
: e4   90.50748

Suppose we want to estimate the premium on education, relative to the least educated class.  We can then specify the following regression and print the output directly to $\mbox{\LaTeX}$ using the =xtable= package[fn:: Note that this is a little superfluous, but it's worth examining the different ways to export tables.]:

#+begin_src R :results output graphics latex :exports both :tangle yes :session
xtable(m2 <- lm(wage ~ 1 + e2 + e3 + e4, data = data))
#+end_src

\end{table}
#+END_LaTeX

None that the coefficients, now, indicate the premium over the base level of education for all subsequent levels.  Consider, for example, the premium on the =e4= class.  The average wage for people in this class, the class with the highest educational attainment levels, is found by:

#+begin_src R :results output graphics :exports both :tangle yes :session
mean(data[e4 == 1, c("wage")])
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: [1] 1196.959

This is equivalent to adding the coefficient on =e4= to the intercept from the well-specified regression above.  Specifically:

#+begin_src R :results output graphics :exports both :tangle yes :session
b <- m2$coefficients
b[["(Intercept)"]] + b[["e4"]]
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: [1] 1196.959

This equality only holds because there are no other covariates in the regression.  If we condition on age, for example, then the simple addition does not yield an average wage.  For illustration, consider the previous regression with =age= and squared =age= as cofactors.  Note also the manner by which the =lm()= function accepts a nested function to specify squared =age= within the line:

#+begin_src R :results output graphics :exports both :tangle yes :session
coef(summary(lm(wage ~ 1 + e2 + e3 + e4 + age + I(age^2), data = data)))
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:

: I(age^2)      -0.2572671    1.508597 -0.17053405 8.646273e-01

It looks like age has a positive but diminishing effect on wage.  This makes sense, maybe, but the coefficients are not significantly different from zero.  Why might this be the case?  This is where some non-parametric graphing comes in handy.

We use the =ggplot2= package instead of the base =R= plotting facilities.  The plots reveal a reasonable relationship between wage and age, but there is a significant amount of variation in wage, relative to the short time frame of age.

* Puzzle (sort of)						   :noexport:

We will replicate the results of a sort of silly study that examines
the causes of McCarthyism, using a /path model/.  The study was
published in the /American Political Science Review/ by Gibson (1988)
and reprinted in Freedman (2009) to illustrate path models, which are
essentially a simple graphical framework to keep track of direct and
indirect causation.  The path model is recreated in Figure
(\ref{fig:path}), and shows that tolerance scores of both the masses
and elites directly impact repression.  This is a theoretical
framework.  The unlabeled connection between the tolerance nodes
indicates association rather than causation.  The repression and
tolerance scores have been standardized, so that they have mean equal
to zero and standard deviation equal to one.\\

The purpose of this exercise is to build up an intuition of the
relationship between the OLS estimates and covariate correlations.

        \label{fig:path}
\end{figure}

Gibson reports the correlation matrix for the path diagram:

|         | Masses | Elite | Repress |
|---------+--------+-------+---------|
| Masses  |   1.00 |  0.52 |   -0.26 |
| Elite   |   0.52 |  1.00 |   -0.42 |
| Repress |  -0.26 | -0.42 |    1.00 |

His model for political repression for $n = 36$ states is given by:
\begin{equation}
\var{repression} = \beta_1 \cdot \var{mass tolerance} + \beta_2 \cdot
\var{elite tolerance} + \epsilon,
\label{eq:one}
\end{equation} Denote $\var{mass tolerance}$ as $M$, $\var{elite
tolerance}$ as $E$, and $\var{repression}$ as $R$, such that Equation
(\ref{eq:one}) becomes $R = \beta_1 M + \beta_2 E + \epsilon$.  Finally,
let $\X = [M \hspace{8pt} E]$, so that $R = \X\beta + \epsilon$.  \\

Here is the kicker.  Since, all  variables were standardized, we know that
\[
\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n E_i = 0 \qquad \and \qquad \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n E_i^2 = 1
\]

This is true, also, for $M$ and $R$.  Being careful about matrix
multiplication, we can compute the following:
\begin{equation}
\Xp\X = \left[
\begin{array}{cc}
\sumi M_i^2 & \sumi M_i E_i \\
\sumi M_i E_i & \sumi E_i^2  \\
\end{array}\right] =
n\left[
\begin{array}{cc}
1 & r_{ME} \\
r_{ME} & 1
\end{array}
\right]=
n\left[
\begin{array}{cc}
1 & 0.52 \\
0.52 & 1
\end{array}
\right]
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\Xp R = \left[
\begin{array}{cc}
\sumi M_i R_i  \\
\sumi E_i R_i \\
\end{array}\right] =
n\left[
\begin{array}{cc}
r_{MR} \\
r_{ER}
\end{array}
\right]=
n\left[
\begin{array}{cc}
-0.26 \\
-0.42
\end{array}
\right]
\end{equation}

We don't even need the actual data to compute the OLS coefficients!
Specifically, $\beta = (\Xp\X)^{-1}\Xp R$:

#+begin_src R :results output graphics :exports both :tangle yes :session
  n <- 36
  xtx <- n * matrix(c(1, 0.52, 0.52, 1), ncol = 2)
  xtr <- n * matrix(c(-0.26, -0.42), ncol = 1)
  (b <- solve(xtx) %*% xtr)
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
:             [,1]
: [1,] -0.05701754
: [2,] -0.39035088

Given standardized tolerance and repression scores, we can use the
following formula from page 85 in Freedman to calculate the model
variance: $\sigsh = 1 - \hat{\beta}_1^2 - \hat{\beta}_2^2 -
2\hat{\beta}_1\hat{\beta}_2 r_{ME}$

#+begin_src R :results output graphics :exports both :tangle yes :session
  p <- 3
  (sigma.hat.sq <- (n / (n - p)) * (1 - b[1]^2 - b[2]^2 - 2 * b[1] * b[2] * 0.52))
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: [1] 0.8958852

There is an implicit intercept, since the scores are standardized, so
that $p = 3$.  We compute the standard errors from the estimated
covariance matrix, $\sigsh(\Xp\X)^{-1}$.  Note that $\V(\hat{\beta}_k|\X)
= \sigsh(\Xp\X)_{kk}^{-1}$:

#+begin_src R :results output graphics :exports both :tangle yes :session
  vcov.mat <- sigma.hat.sq * solve(xtx)
  se1 <- sqrt(vcov.mat[1,1])
  se2 <- sqrt(vcov.mat[2,2])
  pt(b[1]/se1, n - p)
  pt(b[2]/se2, n - p)
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: [1] 0.3797346
: [1] 0.02109715

The coefficient on $\var{mass tolerance}$ is not significant, but the
coefficient on $\var{elite tolerance}$ is significant.  But are the
two coefficients significantly different from each other?  Let $\Rb =
[1 \hspace{8pt} -1]$ and $\r = [0]$.  Then the following test
statistic will test that the two coefficients are equal.

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:F}
F = \frac{(\Rb \hat{\beta} - \r)^{\prime}[\Rb(\Xp\X)^{-1}\Rbp]^{-1}(\Rb \hat{\beta} - \r)}{\sigsh}
\end{equation}

#+begin_src R :results output graphics :exports both :tangle yes :session
  R <- t(matrix(c(-1, 1))); r <- 0
  G <- R %*% b - r
  (F <- (G %*% R %*% solve(xtx) %*% t(R) %*% t(G))/sigma.hat.sq)
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
:            [,1]
: [1,] 0.01435461

The test statistic follows the $F$-distribution, and is not
significant at any reasonable $p$-value.  So, while $\var{elite
tolerance}$ may be significant in the regression of repression on
tolerance, it is not significantly different than the insignificant
variable $\var{mass tolerance}$.
