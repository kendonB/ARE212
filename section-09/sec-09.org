*The dirty business of data cleaning* \hfill
*ARE212*: Section 09 \\ \hline \bigskip

In the real world, data is messy. The process of turning messy, poorly structured data into cleaned data ready for analysis is called *data cleaning*. Those of us who aren't yet fancy enough to hire research assistants can expect to do a great deal of this in the initial stages of research. It can be frustrating, so to ease your introduction into that process by providing you with a few basic tools here. \\

To illustrate, we'll work through a real-life research question that I developed some time ago. We'll be investigating whether state-level belief in climate change is affected by changes in the presence of carbon-intensive industries. Our goal is to construct a dataset in which we can run following regression:

$$ \text{CC Belief}_{st} = \alpha + \text{Oil/Gas Employment}_{st} + \varepsilon_{st} $$

where $s$ represents the state, and $t$ is some time period.

* Loading the data
To measure our dependent variable, belief in climate change, we'll use a series of Pew Surveys[fn:: Available from http://www.people-press.org/question-search/.] that asked randomly selected individuals a series of questions about their beliefs in global warming. We'll be primarily interested in their answer to the following: \\

/From what you've read and heard, is there solid evidence that the average temperature on earth has been getting warmer over the past few decades, or not?/ \\

When I did this project, I actually loaded in data from eight surveys. We'll focus on just two, one from November 2011 and the other from October 2012. After downloading them from the appropriate spot on the Pew website[fn:: Surprisingly non-trivial, but this isn't a course on navigating websites so I'll skip over that.], we load the October 2012 data into =R=.

#+begin_src R :results output :exports both :tangle yes :session
rm(list = ls())
oct12.df <- read.table("EarlyOct12 public.csv", header = T, sep = ",")
head(names(oct12.df))
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: [1] "X"        "psraid"   "sample"   "int_date" "fcall"    "attempt"

Since we only care about a small subset of the variables reported on in the survey, we'll keep those and drop the rest. This is done by requesting either certain column numbers or certain variable names; here, we'll use variable names. Since the variable names aren't very informative, we'll need the documentation.

#+begin_src R :results output :exports both :tangle yes :session
oct12.df <- oct12.df[c("int_date","state","q61")]
head(oct12.df, n = 1)
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
:   int_date         state q61
: 1   100412 Massachusetts Yes

* Finding errors
Great! We've got some data. When loading any new dataset, however, we should be wary of errors. In this case, we have very lengthy question answers. We might be worried that these long character strings are encoded with typos for some observations. One way to look into this is to code these long character strings as factor variables, which we covered last time. This allows us to see all of the unique values the variable takes. It also has the added benefit of reducing memory usage and making analysis easier. Win-win-win!

#+begin_src R :results output :exports both :tangle yes :session
oct12.df$q1f <- factor(oct12.df$q61)
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:

We can examine the levels of the different factors using the =levels= command. The levels of a factor variable are just the number of different values this variable assumes in the data.

#+begin_src R :results output :exports both :tangle yes :session
levels(oct12.df$q1f)
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: [1] "(VOL.) Don't know/Refused"  "(VOL.) Mixd/some evidence"
: [3] "(VOL.) Mixed/some evidence" "No"
: [5] "Yes"

Uh oh! It looks like =q1f= has an error somewhere --- something was misentered[fn:: In fairness to the Pew people, I created this error. Their data is unusually clean.] and now we have two redundant factors. An easy way to fix this is to change the original character variable, =q61=, and then make it into a factor again.

#+begin_src R :results output :exports both :tangle yes :session
badindices <- which(oct12.df$q61 == c("(VOL.) Mixd/some evidence"))
oct12.df$q61[badindices] <- "(VOL.) Mixed/some evidence"
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:

This is a good time to talk about the =which= command, which I just used. =which= gives the =TRUE= indices of a logical object, letting us locate the errors. In this case, there is only one, and we can fix it by setting the correct string. Is it fixed?

#+begin_src R :results output :exports both :tangle yes :session
oct12.df$q1f <- factor(oct12.df$q61)
levels(oct12.df$q1f)
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: [1] "(VOL.) Don't know/Refused"  "(VOL.) Mixed/some evidence"
: [3] "No"                         "Yes"

It's fixed! Now let's load November 2011 survey data and format it similarly.

#+begin_src R :results output :exports both :tangle yes :session
nov11.df <- read.table("Nov11 public.csv", header = T, sep = ",")
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:

But we have to be careful here, since the number of the relevant question has changed. We again turn to the documentation. This is why you should always save documentation when you download data! Don't wait to get it later. You'll forget where it is.

#+begin_src R :results output :exports both :tangle yes :session
nov11.df <- nov11.df[c("int_date","state","q65")]
nov11.df$q1f <- factor(nov11.df$q65)
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:

Notice that I've conviently named the factor variables to match =oct12.df=. This is not by accident, since we ultimate want to join the two data frames together. But first, we need to check the levels of our factor variables again. Are they the same?

#+begin_src R :results output :exports both :tangle yes :session
all(levels(nov11.df$q1f) == levels(oct12.df$q1f))
levels(nov11.df$q1f)
levels(oct12.df$q1f)
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: [1] FALSE
: [1] "Don’t know/Refused (VOL.)"  "Mixed/some evidence (VOL.)"
: [3] "No"                         "Yes"
: [1] "(VOL.) Don't know/Refused"  "(VOL.) Mixed/some evidence"
: [3] "No"                         "Yes"

Crap, they don't match. This is a dumb problem. Fortunately, since they're in the same order, it's easy to fix.

#+begin_src R :results output :exports both :tangle yes :session
levels(nov11.df$q1f) <- levels(oct12.df$q1f) <- c("Don't know","Mixed","No","Yes")
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:

Note that we also simplied the factor levels. Now, let's put these data frames together! We'll use =rbind=.

#+begin_src R :results output :exports both :tangle yes :session
data.df <- rbind(nov11.df, oct12.df)
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: Error in match.names(clabs, names(xi)) :
:   names do not match previous names

Crap again. The names don't match because the original question variable names don't match. But, we set the factor variables names so that they *would* match! Since the factor variables contain all of the information in the character variables, let's only use the well-named factor variables.

#+begin_src R :results output :exports both :tangle yes :session
data.df <- rbind(nov11.df[, c(1, 2, 4)], oct12.df[, c(1, 2, 4)])
head(data.df, n = 3)
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
:   int_date        state        q1f
: 1   110911     Michigan         No
: 2   110911 Pennsylvania      Mixed
: 3   110911     Maryland Don't know

* Dealing with dates
Great! Getting there. We have the date of the interview, the state of the respondent, and their answers to the survey questions. Let's take a closer look at our =int_date= variable. What kind of variable is it?

#+begin_src R :results output :exports both :tangle yes :session
class(data.df$int_date)
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: [1] "integer"

It's an integer. This is okay, but it's not ideal. Often, we'll want to use a particular type of variable to store dates --- this is often more efficient, memory-wise, and it enables us to use a wide variety of date-specific functions. To turn =int_date= into a date variable, we'll first turn it into a character string and then use the function =as.Date= to convert it to a date that =R= will recognize.

#+begin_src R :results output :exports both :tangle yes :session
data.df$int_date.str <- as.character(data.df$int_date)
data.df$int_date.date <- as.Date(data.df$int_date.str, format = "%y%d%m")
class(data.df$int_date.date)
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: [1] "Date"

That's it! We now have a functioning date variable. This is useful for many reasons; for example, we can now the =weekdays= command to determine on what day of the week the survey occured.

#+begin_src R :results output :exports both :tangle yes :session
dow <- weekdays(data.df$int_date.date)
head(dow)
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: [1] "Wednesday" "Wednesday" "Wednesday" "Wednesday" "Saturday"  "Monday"

* Dropping, renaming, and reording variables

Often while cleaning, we'll end up with extraneous variables that we created in the process of making other variables. We could just leave them be, but if we're working with a lot of data or if we are just a tiny bit obsessive about not letting our environment get flooded with objects[fn:: Guilty!] we might want to clean it up every now and again. There are many ways to drop variables, some of which we've already covered. Passing the value =NULL= to a variable is another. \\

Also, we often want to rename and reorder variables within a data frame. Fortunately, =R= makes all of this easy. First, we'll drop our extraneous string and integer variables from our data frame. Then, we'll rename the awkwardly entitled =data.df$int_date.date= to just =data.df$int_date=. Finally, we'll reorder our data with the date at the beginning.

#+begin_src R :results output :exports both :tangle yes :session
data.df$int_date.str <- data.df$int_date <- NULL
names(data.df)[names(data.df) == "int_date.date"] <- "int.date"
data.df <- data.df[c(3, 1, 2)]
head(data.df)
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
:     int.date        state        q1f
: 1 2011-11-09     Michigan         No
: 2 2011-11-09 Pennsylvania      Mixed
: 3 2011-11-09     Maryland Don't know
: 4 2011-11-09     New York        Yes
: 5 2011-11-12  Connecticut        Yes
: 6 2011-11-14      Florida        Yes

* Collapsing data
We've got our dependent variables --- in fact, we have a few of them. Now we want state employment by year we can get these from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The ones I found are actually a set of excel files that require some additional formatting to use in our setting. However, to save time and sanity[fn:: Importing excel files in =R= is actually non-trivial and requires either Perl, Java, or an OS-specific package. None of these are easy to present in section, so I'll omit them now. See the following link for help on importing excel files: http://tinyurl.com/m9pbz8v.], I've skipped some steps here and created =oilgas_emp.csv=, which we'll import now. Party on, Wayne.

#+begin_src R :results output :exports both :tangle yes :session
oilgas.df <- read.table("oilgas_emp.csv", header = T, sep = ",")
head(oilgas.df)
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
:   year month oilgas_emp   N   state
: 1 2003     1        676 657 ALABAMA
: 2 2003     2        676 657 ALABAMA
: 3 2003     3        676 657 ALABAMA
: 4 2003     4        665 657 ALABAMA
: 5 2003     5        662 657 ALABAMA
: 6 2003     6        657 657 ALABAMA

Party on, Garth. We'll just focus on the variable =N=, which is the annual employment level for each state-year. This means that we can drop all of the extraneous observations that list the monthly employment, a process which is called collapsing the data. =Stata= users will recall the command =collapse= which performs this function; =R= does it using =aggregate=, among other methods.

#+begin_src R :results output :exports both :tangle yes :session
oilgas.yearly <- aggregate(oilgas.df$N, by = list(oilgas.df$year, oilgas.df$state), FUN = mean)
names(oilgas.yearly) <- c("year", "state", "emp")
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:

=aggregate= takes in the variable we want to aggregate over, a list of grouping elements, and the function to apply to each subset. We use =mean= since we're taking the mean over the year of an annual statistic, which returns... the annual statistic. A little silly, but it works. After renaming our new data frame appropriately, we've got something we can merge to our =data.df= data frame!

* Merging data
Before merging, we need to make sure that the values in our variables match up. There are two things we need to fix. First, the =state= in =oilgas.yearly= is upper-case, while the =state= in =data.df= is not. Let's fix that.

#+begin_src R :results output :exports both :tangle yes :session
data.df$state <- toupper(data.df$state)
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:

Since we're matching on year, we also need a =year= variable in our =data.df=. There are a few ways to do this, but the way I find most intuitive is to use the =format= function on our date variable and then convert it to =numeric=.

#+begin_src R :results output :exports both :tangle yes :session
data.df$year <- as.numeric(format(data.df$int.date, "%Y"))
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:

Great! Now, we're ready to merge. We've conveniently named our variables so that they match in both data frames, but this isn't strictly necessary in =R=. It just makes life easier.

#+begin_src R :results output :exports both :tangle yes :session
merged.df <- merge(x = data.df, y = oilgas.yearly, by = c("year", "state"), all.x = T)
head(merged.df)
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
:   year   state   int.date        q1f emp
: 1 2010 ALABAMA 2010-12-07 Don't know 779
: 2 2010 ALABAMA 2010-12-04        Yes 779
: 3 2010 ALABAMA 2010-12-07        Yes 779
: 4 2010 ALABAMA 2010-12-06        Yes 779
: 5 2010 ALABAMA 2010-12-05         No 779
: 6 2010 ALABAMA 2010-12-06         No 779

The first two arguments are our two date frames, =by= specifies a vector of variables that we want to merge on, and =all.x = T= indicates to =R= that we should keep all of the observations from our first dataset, =data.df=, even if they don't have a match in =oilgas.yearly=.

* A neat graph
What can we do with this dataset? Let's do a little plotting, to start. We haven't worked with factor (categorical) variables much before, so this is a good opportunity to practice graphing them. What if we want to see the proportion of responses by state? Again, we'll load and use =ggplot2=.

#+begin_src R :results output graphics :file inserts/fig1.png :width 800 :height 600 :session :tangle yes :exports both
library(ggplot2)
merged.df$q1f <- factor(merged.df$q1f, levels = c("Yes", "Mixed", "No", "Don't know"))
ggplot(merged.df, aes(x = state, fill = q1f)) + geom_bar(position = "fill") +
  coord_flip() + theme(axis.text.y=element_text(size=rel(0.8)))
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
[[file:inserts/fig1.png]]

There are lots of things we might like to improve about this graph, starting with the order of the states, but it's a nice visual.

* Running regressions
We're almost to the point where we can run a regression with our data. However, we need to make some decisions first. \\

First, how should we encode =q1f=: should we treat it as an ordered variable, with increasing levels of certainty in global warming encoded as a higher number? Or should we simply code it as 1 if yes and 0 otherwise? There's no right answer here, it just depends on our research design. For ease of demonstration, we'll follow the binary route. \\

Second, what is the appropriate level of observation for our regression? The natural choice would be to run OLS with each response as an observation, but this is actually not a good idea. First because OLS is not appropriate when our dependent variable is binary[fn:: For more on this see Greene chapter 17.], and second because our independent variable, oil and gas employment by state-year, does not vary for individuals within a given state-year. So if we don't cluster our errors appropriately, we may overstate our statistical power when calculating test statistics. \\

Since we haven't learned about logistic regression (the solution to having a binary dependent variable) or clustering, the easiest option is to run OLS on the average response by state-year. Once again, we'll use the =aggregate= command.

#+begin_src R :results output :exports both :tangle yes :session
merged.df$q1b <- ifelse(merged.df$q1f == "Yes", 1, 0)
bystate.df <- aggregate(cbind(merged.df$q1b,merged.df$emp),
  by = list(merged.df$year, merged.df$state), FUN = mean)
names(bystate.df) <- c("year","state","yes","emp")
tail(bystate.df)
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
:     year         state       yes  emp
: 97  2010 WEST VIRGINIA 0.5714286 2244
: 98  2011 WEST VIRGINIA 0.6000000 2181
: 99  2010     WISCONSIN 0.7407407   NA
: 100 2011     WISCONSIN 0.6666667   NA

: 102 2011       WYOMING 0.4000000 4316

By looking at the tail of our data we can see that some values are missing from =emp=. We clearly don't want to include these in our regression, so we'll need to drop them. The easiest way to do this is to use =is.na=.

#+begin_src R :results output :exports both :tangle yes :session
bystate.df <- bystate.df[!is.na(bystate.df$emp), ]
tail(bystate.df)
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
:     year         state       yes  emp
: 93  2010      VIRGINIA 0.6538462  446
: 94  2011      VIRGINIA 0.6896552  445
: 97  2010 WEST VIRGINIA 0.5714286 2244
: 98  2011 WEST VIRGINIA 0.6000000 2181
: 101 2010       WYOMING 0.0000000 4197
: 102 2011       WYOMING 0.4000000 4316

Okay! We're ready to run OLS.

#+begin_src R :results output :exports both :tangle yes :session
OLS <- function(y,X) {
  n <- nrow(X); k <- ncol(X)
  b <- solve(t(X) %*% X) %*% t(X) %*% y
  e <- y - X %*% b; s2 <- t(e) %*% e / (n - k); XpXinv <- solve(t(X) %*% X)
  se <- sqrt(s2 * diag(XpXinv))
  t <- b / se
  p <- 2 * pt(-abs(t),n-k)
  output <- data.frame(b, se, t, p)
  colnames(output) <- c("Estimate","Std. Error", "t statistic", "p-value")
  return(output)
}
y <- bystate.df$yes
X <- cbind(1, bystate.df$emp)
(output <- OLS(y,X))
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
:       Estimate   Std. Error t statistic      p-value
: 1 6.028694e-01 1.947178e-02  30.9611805 1.388631e-42
: 2 2.488441e-07 1.311483e-06   0.1897425 8.500601e-01

Well, we didn't find anything. Darn. Of course, there are some really huge problems with this regression, at least the way we've set it up. Can you see them?

* What else?
Cleaning data is almost always an adventure, since every project will present different and entirely unique challenges. At first, the cleaning process will seem interminably long and tedious, but you'll become faster over time. You'll develop habits of research that enable to get you to your end goal as quickly as possible. I couldn't possibly cover everything you'll need to know to clean your next dataset, but I hope to have laid at least a bit of a blueprint. In my own research, I've found it valuable to spend some time thinking about exactly what regression I want to run so that I always have an idea of where I'm headed. It's important to keep the goal in mind when cleaning so that you don't run down too many rabbit holes before you're even sure if the project is worth pursuing. If it's not mission critical for the basic question that you want to ask, make a note to yourself, move on, and return to it later.
* Future sections
Since only four sections remain after this one, I want to solicit your feedback on what you'd like to learn in the remaining sections. At present, my plan is to do the following: \\

*Section 10*: Instrumental Variables \\
*Section 11*: Web scraping in =R= \\
*Section 12*: Spatial analysis \\
*Section 13*: Using and analyzing satellite imagery \\

I'm not married to this itinerary, however. You should note that only section 10 will be directly pertinent to what Max is covering in lecture --- the others are topics I've included due to personal interest. If there is a strong desire to cover other topics (or to do a general review section), I'm happy to change this plan.
